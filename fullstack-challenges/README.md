# Challenge - Dashboard

You are provided with 3 files:

- [users.json](./users.json) - File with fake user data
- [courses.json](./courses.json) - File with courses data
- [certificates.json](./certificates.json) - File with data about which users completed which courses and when they started/finished

## Specs

Given the data you are provided with, we would like you to build:

- A service that exposes the data via API(s) to be consubme by a web page (UI)
- A web page that displays a report with:
  - possibility to filter data per user
  - display general statistics
    - Average completion time
    - Who completed faster

## Bonus points

Feel free to explore any additional reporting. Here are some ideas:

- Search by time (how many users completed courses in the morning/afternoon/night?)
- Course completion rate (which course has most completion or abandon rate?)
- What are the shorter and longer courses? (based on average completion time)
- Anything else you can think of ðŸ˜€

## Instructions

- Logic and architecture is up to you
- Look and feel (UI/UX) is up to you

## What we will assess/look for

- How you structure your code
- Documentation
- Tests
